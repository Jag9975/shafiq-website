        <h2>Fingerprinting the Fingerprinters: Learning to Detect Browser Fingerprinting Behaviors</h2>
        <h5>IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy (“Oakland”), 2021.</h5>
        <p>Abstract: Browser fingerprinting is an invasive and opaque
            stateless tracking technique. Browser vendors, academics, and
            standards bodies have long struggled to provide meaningful
            protections against browser fingerprinting that are both accurate and do not degrade user experience. We propose FPINSPECTOR, a machine learning based syntactic-semantic approach to accurately detect browser fingerprinting. We show
            that FP-INSPECTOR performs well, allowing us to detect 26%
            more fingerprinting scripts than the state-of-the-art. We show
            that an API-level fingerprinting countermeasure, built upon
            FP-INSPECTOR, helps reduce website breakage by a factor of
            2. We use FP-INSPECTOR to perform a measurement study
            of browser fingerprinting on top-100K websites. We find that
            browser fingerprinting is now present on more than 10% of the
            top-100K websites and over a quarter of the top-10K websites. We
            also discover previously unreported uses of JavaScript APIs by
            fingerprinting scripts suggesting that they are looking to exploit
            APIs in new and unexpected ways.</p>
