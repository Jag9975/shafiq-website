        <h2>Understanding Incentivized Mobile App Installs on Google Play Store</h2>
        <h5>ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2020.</h5>
        <p>Abstract: “Incentivized” advertising platforms allow mobile app developers
            to acquire new users by directly paying users to install and engage
            with mobile apps (e.g., create an account, make in-app purchases).
            Incentivized installs are banned by the Apple App Store and discouraged by the Google Play Store because they can manipulate
            app store metrics (e.g., install counts, appearance in top charts).
            Yet, many organizations still ofer incentivized install services for
            Android apps. In this paper, we present the frst study to understand the ecosystem of incentivized mobile app install campaigns
            in Android and its broader ramifcations through a series of measurements. We identify incentivized install campaigns that require
            users to install an app and perform in-app tasks targeting manipulation of a wide variety of user engagement metrics (e.g., daily
            active users, user session lengths) and revenue. Our results suggest
            that these artifcially infated metrics can be efective in improving
            app store metrics as well as helping mobile app developers to attract funding from venture capitalists. Our study also indicates lax
            enforcement of the Google Play Store’s existing policies to prevent
            these behaviors. It further motivates the need for stricter policing
            of incentivized install campaigns. Our proposed measurements can
            also be leveraged by the Google Play Store to identify potential
            policy violations.</p>
