        <h2>CV-Inspector: Towards Automating Detection of Adblock Circumvention</h2>
        <h5>Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), 2021.</h5>
        <p>Abstract: The adblocking arms race has escalated over the
            last few years. An entire new ecosystem of circumvention (CV)
            services has recently emerged that aims to bypass adblockers
            by obfuscating site content, making it difficult for adblocking
            filter lists to distinguish between ads and functional content. In
            this paper, we investigate recent anti-circumvention efforts by
            the adblocking community that leverage custom filter lists. In
            particular, we analyze the anti-circumvention filter list (ACVL),
            which supports advanced filter rules with enriched syntax and
            capabilities designed specifically to counter circumvention. We
            show that keeping ACVL rules up-to-date requires expert list
            curators to continuously monitor sites known to employ CV
            services and to discover new such sites in the wild â€” both
            tasks require considerable manual effort. To help automate
            and scale ACVL curation, we develop CV-INSPECTOR, a machine learning approach for automatically detecting adblock
            circumvention using differential execution analysis. We show that
            CV-INSPECTOR achieves 93% accuracy in detecting sites that
            successfully circumvent adblockers. We deploy CV-INSPECTOR
            on top-20K sites to discover the sites that employ circumvention
            in the wild. We further apply CV-INSPECTOR to a list of sites that
            are known to utilize circumvention and are closely monitored by
            ACVL authors. We demonstrate that CV-INSPECTOR reduces the
            human labeling effort by 98%, which removes a major bottleneck
            for ACVL authors. Our work is the first large-scale study of the
            state of the adblock circumvention arms race, and makes an
            important step towards automating anti-CV efforts.</p>
