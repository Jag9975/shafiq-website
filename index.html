                <h2>Fingerprinting the Fingerprinters: Learning to Detect Browser Fingerprinting Behaviors</h2>
                <h5>IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy (“Oakland”), 2021.</h5>
                <p>Abstract: Browser fingerprinting is an invasive and opaque
                    stateless tracking technique. Browser vendors, academics, and
                    standards bodies have long struggled to provide meaningful
                    protections against browser fingerprinting that are both accurate and do not degrade user experience. We propose FPINSPECTOR, a machine learning based syntactic-semantic approach to accurately detect browser fingerprinting. We show
                    that FP-INSPECTOR performs well, allowing us to detect 26%
                    more fingerprinting scripts than the state-of-the-art. We show
                    that an API-level fingerprinting countermeasure, built upon
                    FP-INSPECTOR, helps reduce website breakage by a factor of
                    2. We use FP-INSPECTOR to perform a measurement study
                    of browser fingerprinting on top-100K websites. We find that
                    browser fingerprinting is now present on more than 10% of the
                    top-100K websites and over a quarter of the top-10K websites. We
                    also discover previously unreported uses of JavaScript APIs by
                    fingerprinting scripts suggesting that they are looking to exploit
                    APIs in new and unexpected ways.</p>

                <h2>CV-Inspector: Towards Automating Detection of Adblock Circumvention</h2>
                <h5>Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), 2021.</h5>
                <p>Abstract: The adblocking arms race has escalated over the
                    last few years. An entire new ecosystem of circumvention (CV)
                    services has recently emerged that aims to bypass adblockers
                    by obfuscating site content, making it difficult for adblocking
                    filter lists to distinguish between ads and functional content. In
                    this paper, we investigate recent anti-circumvention efforts by
                    the adblocking community that leverage custom filter lists. In
                    particular, we analyze the anti-circumvention filter list (ACVL),
                    which supports advanced filter rules with enriched syntax and
                    capabilities designed specifically to counter circumvention. We
                    show that keeping ACVL rules up-to-date requires expert list
                    curators to continuously monitor sites known to employ CV
                    services and to discover new such sites in the wild — both
                    tasks require considerable manual effort. To help automate
                    and scale ACVL curation, we develop CV-INSPECTOR, a machine learning approach for automatically detecting adblock
                    circumvention using differential execution analysis. We show that
                    CV-INSPECTOR achieves 93% accuracy in detecting sites that
                    successfully circumvent adblockers. We deploy CV-INSPECTOR
                    on top-20K sites to discover the sites that employ circumvention
                    in the wild. We further apply CV-INSPECTOR to a list of sites that
                    are known to utilize circumvention and are closely monitored by
                    ACVL authors. We demonstrate that CV-INSPECTOR reduces the
                    human labeling effort by 98%, which removes a major bottleneck
                    for ACVL authors. Our work is the first large-scale study of the
                    state of the adblock circumvention arms race, and makes an
                    important step towards automating anti-CV efforts.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Incentivized Mobile App Installs on Google Play Store</h2>
                <h5>ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2020.</h5>
                <p>Abstract: “Incentivized” advertising platforms allow mobile app developers
                    to acquire new users by directly paying users to install and engage
                    with mobile apps (e.g., create an account, make in-app purchases).
                    Incentivized installs are banned by the Apple App Store and discouraged by the Google Play Store because they can manipulate
                    app store metrics (e.g., install counts, appearance in top charts).
                    Yet, many organizations still ofer incentivized install services for
                    Android apps. In this paper, we present the frst study to understand the ecosystem of incentivized mobile app install campaigns
                    in Android and its broader ramifcations through a series of measurements. We identify incentivized install campaigns that require
                    users to install an app and perform in-app tasks targeting manipulation of a wide variety of user engagement metrics (e.g., daily
                    active users, user session lengths) and revenue. Our results suggest
                    that these artifcially infated metrics can be efective in improving
                    app store metrics as well as helping mobile app developers to attract funding from venture capitalists. Our study also indicates lax
                    enforcement of the Google Play Store’s existing policies to prevent
                    these behaviors. It further motivates the need for stricter policing
                    of incentivized install campaigns. Our proposed measurements can
                    also be leveraged by the Google Play Store to identify potential
                    policy violations.</p>
